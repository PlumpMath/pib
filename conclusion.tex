\section{Conclusion}

Our projects aims at developing open-source plug-in for the free animation software named Blender. Our goal is to bridge the gap between commercial and free animation software, concerning the animation of crowds and the generation of environments. Although commercial software do not provide any source, there is still a lot of academic papers enabling us to focus on the implementation of already-existing techniques. Right now, we do not have a working prototype, but we have a precise description of each of our plugin, at least on the non-graphical part. 

The biggest problem encountered is the generation of the animation, on which we have to pass more time to study bibliographical elements.\\
On the other hand, we had a lot of good surprises about the code, especially about the Blender API, which is really complete and easy to use, it took not so many time to be used to it.
