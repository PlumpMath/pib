\section{WP0 - Communication}

The goal of this work package is to handle communications, both within the whole project group and with people not involved in this project (for example, the Blender community). Up to now, we have not done much: the purpose of this group is mainly to spread the software until a stable version is released. We created a forum thread on the website blenderartist (\cite{blenderartist}), to see if the blender community had special needs. We also took notes of every meeting we had on a wiki (\cite{comptesrendus}), and created a (yet really simple) website (\cite{site}). We are also responsible for the redaction and finalization of the reports (although we asked for this mid-year report every Work Package to give us a summary of their state).

\par What needs to be done next? As stated before, we plan to spread the news of the existence of this software when a stable release is published. We will probably update the website with more informations soon, and we will have to finalize the final report too.
