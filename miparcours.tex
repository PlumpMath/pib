\section{General overview of the project}

\subsection{Objectives}
The goal of this project is to improve the open-source 3D software Blender. This software can create 3D scenes from scratch, from modelisation to animation and render.

The aim is to add to blender the feature to generate large populated environments. This is two independents parts: firt generate environments in a semi-automated way. Secondly, generate and animate people of the environment, whose movements must be consistent with the environment and other people's movements.

There have been a lot of reaserches around the procedural generation of crowds and environments in computer graphics. But the large majority are implemented as research prototypes or in commercial softwares. As we know, nothing exists for widely used free softwares like Blender.

The big advantage of producing a code based on Blender is that we can use its Python API, which is very powerful. With it, one can manipulate evry objects and part of the Blender interface without re-compiling blender or even modifying the source code. thus, we can concentrate only one the new parts of the project: our algorithms, we do no need to code another render engine for example.
The other advantage is the Blender community, which already exists, and on which we can rely to have feedbacks on our project.

\subsection{Work Packages}
We decided to create subworking groups, with each group having a separate leader. We detail below the groups, the leader being in bold font.

\begin{enumerate}[label=WP\arabic*:, start=0]
\item Communication: \textbf{\mr}, \me, \js
\item Blender Code: \mr, \textbf{\me}, \ps
\item Bibliography on crowd animation: \dl, \vl, \textbf{\js}
\item Bibliography on environment generation: \bb, \textbf{\gc}, \om
\item Crowd plugin development: \dl, \vl, \me, \textbf{\js}, \ps
\item Environment plugin development: \bb, \textbf{\gc}, \om, \mr, \me,
\item Graphical User Interface (GUI) development: \gc, \textbf{\vl}, \me
\item Trailer: \dl, \textbf{\me}, \js
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Planning}
\begin{description}
  \item[17 Dec. - 21 Jan.] \textit{Implementation}. Code the core which is the code independant from Blender. Start the graphical interface.
  \item[21 Jan. - 4 Feb.] \textit{Blender part}. Code the interface between our classes and Blender objetcs.
  \item[4 Feb. - 18 Feb.] \textit{Graphical interface}. Improving the graphical interface to make it usable by artists.depending ont the defence..
  \item[18 Feb. - ..] \textit{New features}.
Use this time to add new features note developped before like:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item People moving on non-plane surfaces
    \item Improve people animation
    \item Add more environments types
  \end{itemize}
