\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is our mid-year  report of the integrated project called ``Blend'it''. The goal of this project is to design two open-source plugins for Blender, which is a computer graphics software. One of these plugin will be able to render and animate crowds, and the other one to design environments by making different elements such as rivers and mountains automatically interact to produce realistic scenes. Although this kind of software is already developed in the Computer Graphics industry, it is often unavailable to the public and not of free use.

\section{General overview of the project}

\subsection{The crowd simulation}

\todoall{(c) wikipedia et vous devez pouvoir faire mieux sans trop de boulot.} 

Crowd simulation is the process of simulating the movement of a large
number of entities or characters; this technique is now commonly used
in 3D computer graphics for film. While simulating crowds, observed
human behavior and interactions are taken into account to replicate
collective behavior. It is a method of creating virtual
cinematography.

The need for crowd simulation arises when a scene calls for more
characters than can be practically animated using conventional
systems, such as skeletons/bones. Simulating crowds offer the
advantages of being cost effective as well as allow for total control
of each simulated character or agent.

Animators typically create a library of motions, either for an entire
character or for individual body parts. To simplify processing, these
animations are sometimes baked as morphs. Alternately, the motions can
be generated procedurally – i.e. choreographed automatically by
software.

The actual movements and interactions of the crowd are typically
implemented in one of two ways: Particle Motion or Crowd AI.

\subsection{The Blend'it Objectives}

The goal of this project is to improve the open-source 3D software Blender, by providing two new plugins. Blender can create 3D scenes from scratch, from modelling to animation and render.

The aim is to add to Blender the possibility to generate large populated environments. There are two independents parts: first generate environments in a semi-automated way. Secondly, generate and animate people of the environment, whose movements must be consistent with the environment and other people's movements. There are some examples of what has been created by some researchers in figures \ref{fig:crowd} and \ref{fig:env}.

\end{figure}


There have been a lot of researches around the procedural generation of crowds and environments in computer graphics. But the large majority are implemented as research prototypes or in commercial software. To the best of our knowledge, nothing exists for widely used free software like Blender.


\paragraph{Related work.} The animation of large crowds is really developed in the computer graphics industry, enabling commercial 3D software to easily render massive scenes with large crowds. For example, the ILM studio developed a software called Massive (\cite{Massive}) dramatically changed the habits of 3D studios: for example, it helped generating the armies being displayed in \textit{Lord of the Rings}. The Golaem (\cite{Golaem}) software is also able to render massive crowds in different situations, and is used by the studio producing \textit{Game of Thrones}. Nowadays, even commercial standalone 3D software like 3DS MAX\cite{3dsmax} is able to generate realistic crowds. On the contrary, no open-source software provides this kind of feature. In the past, scripts had been developed, but they were not providing realistic results, and are not working anymore.

\paragraph{Choice of Blender.}

The big advantage of producing a code based on Blender is that we can use its Python API, which is very powerful. With it, one can manipulate every objects and part of the Blender interface without re-compiling blender or even modifying the source code. Thus, we can concentrate only one the new parts of the project: our algorithms, we do not need to code another render engine for example.
The other advantage is the Blender community, which already exists, and on which we can rely to have feedback on our project.

\todoall{Ca serait bien de dire aussi ce que Blend'it n'est pas. Par
  exemple pas la peine de chercher des considérations sociologique.}

\todoall{le paragraphe suivant est à remonter dans la section State of
the Art quand vous allez expliquer pourquoi Belnd'it est différent de
tout ce qui existe}

We are 9 Master students from the \textit{École Normale Supérieure de Lyon}, France. As a part of our First year of Master in Research in Computer Science, we need to develop and code a project of our choice (here, ``Blend'it''), during the whole year. We are supervised by an Associate Professor from the ENS Lyon, Eddy Caron. There is a project leader, \me, and a deputy leader, \mr. Please do not hesitate to contact us, by writing an email at \textit{first name . last name @ens-lyon.fr}.\\

All our work is hosted on Github, and can be consulted on \url{github.com/blendit}.

\subsection{Work Packages}
We decided to create sub-working groups, with each group having a separate leader. We detail below the groups, the leader being in bold font.

\begin{enumerate}[label=WP\arabic*:, start=0]
\item Communication: \textbf{\mr}, \me, \js
\item Blender Code: \mr, \textbf{\me}, \ps
\item Bibliography on crowd animation: \dl, \vl, \textbf{\js}
\item Bibliography on environment generation: \bb, \textbf{\gc}, \om
\item Crowd plugin development: \dl, \vl, \me, \textbf{\js}, \ps
\item Environment plugin development: \bb, \textbf{\gc}, \om, \mr, \me,
\item Graphical User Interface (GUI) development: \gc, \textbf{\vl}, \me
\item Trailer: \dl, \textbf{\me}, \js
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Planning}

%% TODO : ajouter le passé du planning?
Our planning for the following weeks is the following:

\begin{description}
  \item[17 Dec. - 21 Jan.] \textit{Implementation}. We plan to code the core which is the code independent from Blender, and start the design and implementation of the graphical interface.
  \item[21 Jan. - 4 Feb.] \textit{Blender part}. We will code the interface between our classes and Blender objects.
  \item[4 Feb. - 18 Feb.] \textit{Graphical interface}. We plan to refine the graphical interface to make it usable by artists. Then, depending on the defence date, we will adapt the following part of the planning.
  \item[18 Feb. - ..] \begin{itemize} \item \textit{Trailer, communication}. We will start to create examples generated by our tools, as well as communicate to and have feedback from the Blender community. \item \textit{New features}.
This will be the time to add new features note developed before like:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item People moving on non-plane surfaces
    \item Improve people animation
    \item Add more environments types
  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}
