\section{Conclusion}

At the end of this project, we were able to render the following animation using our two plug-ins: \url{blendit.github.io/demo.mp4}. Our global proposal is mainly respected: we are able to generate environments provided by the user in an intuitive way, and we are able to generate crowds where people avoid each other. Thanks to a lot of planning, and to the unitary tests, we did not have any tricky bug to fix during the development of our project. Still, we have been slowed down by some difficulties: we did not realize the animation of individuals would take so much time;  we understood the graph implementation was too computationally expensive too late to try another approach; we also did not had the time to develop as many features as we wished concerning the generation of environments. 

\subsection*{Future work}

Our implementation is functional, but can be improved. Among possible improvements, we could try to make both plug-in interact more. Concerning the crowd simulation part, it would be interesting to develop an efficient version of the control of the path using a graph, and maybe add options to create waypoints. Another thing to do is to create an animation for the individuals. Concerning the environment generation, the city feature is not ready yet, and live modifications (going backward to edit a feature) are not supported.
