\subsubsection{Mountains}

Our first implementation of the Mountain feature corresponded to what is presented in \cite{FeatureTree}. However, the 2D random functions we tried did not yield satisfying results. That's why we switched to another version, where we import at random a part of a heightmap taken from a website \cite{terrain-party}. This website import the heightmaps through satellite imaging.
