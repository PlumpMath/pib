\section{Blender exploration team}

During the whole project, this team had two aims: discover Blender and
Python while other teams focused in the bibliographical work, and
ensure our code was healthy by setting up unitary tests and code
coverage tools.

\subsection{Blender discovery}

Blender is written in C++ and Python, but it has a powerful API in
Python, so we did not have to modify the C++ core of Blender. Blender
is also able to show the Python source of its interface, or give the
Python command associated to a manual operation. These features were
really helpful to develop efficiently our programs.
