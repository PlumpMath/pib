\section{Blender exploration team}

During the whole project, this team had two aims. Our first goal was
to discover Blender and Python while other teams focused on the
bibliographical work, to then teach everyone how to use Blender
efficiently and code in Python. Our second goal was to guarantee the
quality of our code by setting up unitary tests and code coverage
tools.

\subsection{Blender discovery}

Blender is written in C++ and Python, but it has a powerful API in
Python, so we did not have to modify the C++ core of Blender. Blender
is also able to show the Python source of its interface, or give the
Python command associated to a manual operation. These features were
really helpful to develop efficiently our programs.


\subsection{Unitary tests}

For each new class we implemented, we also created a unit test
file. The execution was handled by the unitary test library of
Python. We linked our Github repositories with Travis, a website
that runs the unitary test every time a pull request is created.

\subsection{Code coverage}

We also linked our Github repositories with Coveralls, to see what
part of the code was covered by our unitary tests. To ensure a good
coverage, the pull requests had to increase coverage, or they would
automatically be rejected.
